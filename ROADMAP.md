# Goal-Achievement Assessment

## Project Context

- **What it claims to do**: A minimal, pure-Go VP8 I-frame (key-frame) encoder with no CGo dependencies. Produces valid VP8 key-frame bitstreams per RFC 6386, compatible with WebRTC stacks (pion/rtp VP8Payloader, ivfwriter), with configurable quantizer via bitrate target.

- **Target audience**: Go developers needing a lightweight VP8 encoder for WebRTC applications who want to avoid CGo/libvpx dependencies—enabling easier cross-compilation and deployment.

- **Architecture**: Single-package (`vp8`) design with clear separation:
  | File | Responsibility |
  |------|----------------|
  | `encoder.go` | Public API: `NewEncoder`, `Encode`, `SetBitrate` |
  | `bitstream.go` | VP8 frame assembly and header encoding |
  | `bool_encoder.go` | RFC 6386 §7 boolean arithmetic coder |
  | `macroblock.go` | MB processing: prediction, DCT, quantization |
  | `prediction.go` | 16×16 intra prediction modes |
  | `bpred.go` | 4×4 B_PRED sub-modes |
  | `dct.go` | Forward/inverse DCT and WHT transforms |
  | `quant.go` | Quantization tables and factors |
  | `token.go` | Coefficient entropy coding |
  | `partition.go` | Multi-partition infrastructure |
  | `frame.go` | YUV420 frame handling |

- **Existing CI/quality gates**: None. No GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Makefile detected.

- **Unique value proposition**: Research confirms **no other production-ready pure-Go VP8 encoder exists**. Pion/mediadevices requires CGo bindings to libvpx. This project fills a genuine gap in the Go ecosystem.

## Goal-Achievement Summary

| Stated Goal | Status | Evidence | Gap Description |

## Implementation vs. Documentation Gaps

The project has detailed internal tracking in `GAPS.md`. Current status:

| Gap | Status | Impact |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Residual coding pipeline | ✅ CLOSED | Core functionality complete |
| Prediction mode selection | ✅ CLOSED | Modes selected via SAD comparison |
| WebRTC interoperability | ✅ CLOSED | Verified via decode test |
| **B_PRED mode never used** | ⚠️ Blocked | Infrastructure complete but decode bug prevents activation |
| **Multiple partitions never used** | ✅ CLOSED | Now wired - SetPartitionCount() enables 2/4/8 partitions |
| **Quantizer deltas not configurable** | ✅ CLOSED | SetQuantizerDeltas() API exposed |
| **Token probability updates not used** | ⚠️ Open | Functions exist but not called |

## Roadmap

### Priority 1: Documentation Accuracy

The README states "Residuals are skipped (all macroblocks use DC prediction with zero residuals)" but this is no longer true—the encoder now computes and encodes actual residuals.

- [x] Update README.md §Limitations to reflect current state:
  - Remove "Residuals are skipped" 
  - Note that residuals are now computed via DCT/WHT pipeline
  - Keep "I-frame only", "No loop filter" as accurate limitations
- [x] Update README.md §Output format description to mention residuals are now present
- **Validation**: README should accurately describe encoder behavior

### Priority 2: Expose Quantizer Delta API

Per-plane quantizer deltas are implemented in `quant.go` but not accessible. This limits quality tuning for professional use cases.

- [x] Add delta fields to `Encoder` struct in `encoder.go`:
  ```go
  y1DCDelta, y2DCDelta, y2ACDelta, uvDCDelta, uvACDelta int
  ```
- [x] Add `SetQuantizerDeltas(y1dc, y2dc, y2ac, uvdc, uvac int)` method
- [x] Update `Encode()` to call `GetQuantFactors()` with deltas instead of `GetQuantFactorsSimple()`
- [x] Modify `encodeFrameHeader()` in `bitstream.go:44-54` to emit deltas when non-zero
- **Validation**: New test verifying delta values appear in encoded header; decode still succeeds

### Priority 3: Wire B_PRED Mode Selection

The 4×4 B_PRED sub-modes are fully implemented in `bpred.go` but never selected. This limits compression efficiency for content with local detail variations.

- [x] Add B_PRED vs 16×16 mode decision in `processMacroblock()`:
  - Compare best 16×16 mode SAD vs sum of best 4×4 mode SADs
  - Select B_PRED if 4×4 SAD is significantly better (threshold TBD)
- [x] When B_PRED wins, populate `mb.bModes[16]` with selected sub-modes
- [x] Update `encodeYMode()` in `bitstream.go:94-107` to emit 16 sub-block modes when `mode == B_PRED`
- [x] Update `encodeResidualPartition()` to use `PlaneY1SansY2` for B_PRED macroblocks
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Fix B_PRED bitstream encoding - frames with B_PRED macroblocks fail to decode with "unexpected EOF". Infrastructure is complete but `bPredSADThreshold=0` disables selection.
- **Validation**: Test with high-detail content showing B_PRED selection improves PSNR

### Priority 4: Enable Multiple Partitions

Multi-partition encoding infrastructure exists in `partition.go` and is now fully wired into the encoder.

- [x] Add `PartitionCount` field to `Encoder` struct with default `OnePartition`
- [x] Add `SetPartitionCount(count PartitionCount)` method
- [x] Modify `BuildKeyFrame()` to use `PartitionWriter` when count > 1
- [x] Update `encodeFrameHeader()` to emit correct `nb_dct_partitions` value
- [x] Use partition assembly functions in frame assembly path
- [x] **Validation**: Test that 2/4/8 partition frames decode correctly (TestMultiPartitionEncode)

### Priority 5: Add CI Pipeline

No automated testing exists, increasing regression risk.

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Run `go test -race ./...` on push/PR
  - Run `go vet ./...`
  - Test on Linux, macOS, Windows
  - Test on Go 1.24 and 1.25
- **Validation**: CI badge in README; PR checks run automatically

### Priority 6: Add Benchmarking Infrastructure

The project has one benchmark (`BenchmarkEncode640x480`) but no systematic performance tracking.

- [x] Add benchmarks for common resolutions: 320×240, 640×480, 1280×720, 1920×1080
- [ ] Add benchmark comparing with/without B_PRED (blocked on Priority 3)
- [x] Document baseline performance numbers in README
- **Validation**: `go test -bench=.` produces actionable data

## Out of Scope (Not Project Goals)

The following are explicitly **not** project goals per the README:

- **Inter-frame (P-frame) coding**: Project is designed as I-frame only
- **Loop filter**: Explicitly disabled
- **Segmentation**: Not claimed
- **Temporal scalability**: Not claimed

These should not appear on the roadmap unless the project scope changes.

## Dependency Health

| Dependency | Version | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `golang.org/x/image` | v0.37.0 | ✅ No known vulnerabilities (checked 2026-03-24) |
| Go version | 1.25.0 | ✅ Current |

---

## Summary

This project successfully delivers on its core promise: **a working pure-Go VP8 I-frame encoder with no CGo dependencies**. The encoder produces valid bitstreams that decode correctly with standard VP8 decoders. 

The main gaps are:
1. **Documentation drift**: README limitations section is outdated
2. **Unused infrastructure**: B_PRED modes, multi-partition, quantizer deltas are implemented but not wired
3. **No CI**: Manual testing only

The recommended path forward prioritizes documentation accuracy first, then incremental feature enablement of already-implemented capabilities.
